<speak value="The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman State during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming &quot;emperor&quot; in English, it reflects his taking of the title augustus or caesar. Another title often used was imperator, originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title princeps."/>

After the fall of the Roman Republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the &quot;Roman Senate&quot; to the &quot;Roman Emperor.&quot; Beginning with the first emperor, Augustus, the Emperor and the Senate were technically two co-equal branches of government. In practice, however the actual authority of the imperial Senate was negligible, as the Emperor held the true power of the state."/>

He was Caesar from 285 to 286, then Augustus from 286 to 305. He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, Diocletian, whose political brain complemented Maximian&apos;s military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In the late summer of 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. &lt;color=#ff00ffff&gt;Do you recall Maxentius? As it turns out, Maximian was Maxentius’ father.&lt;/color&gt;"/>
