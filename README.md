# **Story Narration** for IBM Bluemix
Developed at [RPI Cognitive Science Department][], a web application for exploring and narrating over knowledge bases. It's main goal is to integrate cutting-edge narration technologies into an interactive website.

The project is a spin-off of [Knowledge Explorer][], a desktop app for building knowledge bases. The app supports both AIMind XML format and [Knowledge API JSON Graph Structure](https://github.com/rellink/knowledge-api/wiki/Graph-Structure).
